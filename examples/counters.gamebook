title = Counters Example
= Introduction
This example gamebook shows how to use counters.
* 1 start
This is where the gamebook starts.
We have counters for [count life]Life Points[/count] and for
[count gold]Gold[/count]. You start the adventure with
[set life]10[/set] and [set gold]12[/set].
You can never have less than [min gold]0[/min]. FIXME need to
figure out best syntax for death when life points go below 1.
Go to [[getgold]] to get more Gold or [[dangerous]] to lose some Life Points.

* getgold
Congratulations, you found [inc gold]2[/gold].
If you have less than [lessthan life]1[/lessthan], turn to [[auto death]].
You can go to [[dangerous]] to lose some life or to [[losegold]] to drop
some gold. If you have at least [atleast gold]16[/atleast] you
can turn to [[hurrah]]. If you have even more than
[morethan gold]16[/morethan] you can turn to [[rich]].

* dangerous
You lose [dec life]1[/dec].
You can go to [[getgold]] to get some Gold.

* losegold
You drop [dec gold]5[/dec]. It should not be possible to
go below 0. Then go on to get gold at [[getgold]] or lose life at [[dangerous]].

* rich
You have more than 16 Gold. How nice.
 Go back to get some more at [[getgold]].

* hurrah
You have at least 16 gold. Go back to get some more at [[getgold]].

* death
Less than 1 Life Point means the adventure ends now.
