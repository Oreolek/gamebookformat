Turn to 1 to begin.

1
 Demonstrating how Codewords (AKA sightings) can be used. Go to 2. 

2
 Got codeword warrior. Simple enough to set a codeword. Turn to 3. 

3
 If you have the codeword warrior you may turn to 9. If you do not have the codeword fun, you may turn to 4. If you have the codeword fun, you may instead turn to 5. Otherwise see 6. 

4
 This is just to demonstrate choices allowed when not having a codeword. Now go on to 8 (autotest) or 6 (xor test). 

5
 Cheater! There is no way you can have codeword fun. 

6
 OK, if you have the codeword warrior, you may turn to 9 otherwise you may go back to 2. Although we both know you have that codeword. If you have the codeword fun you may turn to 5, without it you can go to 4. 

7
 If you have the codeword fun turn to 5. Otherwise you can go to the end at 9 or to the xortest at 6. 

8
 If you have codeword warrior turn to 7. Otherwise you can go to the end at 9 or back to 1. 

9
 That was easy.
