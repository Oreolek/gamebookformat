\b \qc Counters Example
\b0\
\
\b \qc Introduction
\b0\



\ql  This example gamebook shows how to use counters. \
\

\b Turn to 1 to begin.
\b0\
\
\b \qc 1
\b0\
\ql  This is where the gamebook starts. We have counters for Life Points and for Gold. You start the adventure with 10 Life Points
 and 12 Gold
. You can never have less than 0 Gold
. FIXME need to figure out best syntax for death when life points go below 1. Go to \b 7
\b0
 to get more Gold or \b 6
\b0
 to lose some Life Points.  \
\

\b \qc 2
\b0\
\ql  Less than 1 Life Point means the adventure ends now. \
\

\b \qc 3
\b0\
\ql  You have at least 16 gold. Go back to get some more at \b 7
\b0
.  \
\

\b \qc 4
\b0\
\ql  You have more than 16 Gold. How nice. Go back to get some more at \b 7
\b0
.  \
\

\b \qc 5
\b0\
\ql  You drop 5 Gold
. It should not be possible to go below 0. Then go on to get gold at \b 7
\b0
 or lose life at \b 6
\b0
.  \
\

\b \qc 6
\b0\
\ql  You lose 1 Life Points
. You can go to \b 7
\b0
 to get some Gold.  \
\

\b \qc 7
\b0\
\ql  Congratulations, you found 2 Gold
. If you have less than 1, turn to \b 2
\b0
. You can go to \b 6
\b0
 to lose some life or to \b 5
\b0
 to drop some gold. If you have at least 16 you can turn to \b 3
\b0
. If you have even more than 16 you can turn to \b 4
\b0
.  \
