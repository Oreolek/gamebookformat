    Counters Example

Introduction
 This example gamebook shows how to use counters.



Turn to 1 to begin.
1
 This is where the gamebook starts. We have counters for Life Points and for Gold. You start the adventure with 10 Life Points
 and 12 Gold
. You can never have less than 0 Gold
. FIXME need to figure out best syntax for death when life points go below 1. Go to 4 to get more Gold or 3 to lose some Life Points. 

2
 You drop 5 Gold
. It should not be possible to go below 0. Then go on to get gold at 4 or lose life at 3.

3
 You lose 1 Life Points
. You can go to 4 to get some Gold. 

4
 Congratulations, you found 2 Gold
. You can go to 3 to lose some life or to 2 to drop some gold.
