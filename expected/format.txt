 This examples tests gamebook formatting, not so much game mechanics or references. Currently there is nothing here really. This section contains some tricky characters to quote, like } and { and " and ' and \. HTML will probably not like <div> or &boom;. There should be an image below as well. If something broke, turn to 3, otherwise turn to 4. testimage.png
