 This is just an experiment exporting to the markup used in Twine 2 (see http://twinery.org). A known problem is that new-lines are significant in Twine, while they are happily ignored by gamebookformat. The book has to start at section 1 because currently the startnode given in the generated file is hardcoded to 1. Many things like item management and counters are not yet implemented, but from a quick look int the Twine 2 documentation it should be possible to add all that later. Creating a Twine 2 document is done using twine2 output format. Use the "Import From File" link in the Twine 2 web GUI to import the generated file. From here you can go to 3 or the end (2).

 It ends here.

 This is another section, just to try references. You can go on to the end at 2.
