** DONE Debug output
** DONE DOT output
** DONE LaTeX output
** DONE RTF output
** DONE HTML output
** DONE Split out template hanlding into separate class from output
** DONE Inject Output dependencies
** DONE Save section-number mapping and reuse automatically
** DONE Add support for custom document templates.
  Fixed names and/or command-line options.
** DONE Add section links in LaTeX output.
** DONE Prettier LaTeX output
  Look at how some existing gamebooks are formatted.
** DONE Parse wiki-style tags used to mark up sections
** DONE New text formatting style for section references
** DONE Inventory pick up items
** DONE Codewords set
** DONE Check if has inventory item
** DONE Check if has codeword
** DONE Remove item from inventory (forced by instructions)
** DONE Enable link if not having an item
** DONE Enable link if not having a codeword
** DONE Make sure dropped items can not be picked up again
** DONE Fix problem with map file from other book sometimes crashing formatter
** DONE Keys from formatted book should be added to map file, not replace it
** DONE Make inventory and codewords generic
  They are the same, sort of, and it might be good to be able to
  add other similar entities as well, like skills or spells or whatever.
** DONE Otherwise/else handling for has.
** DONE Redesign otherwise/else to use xor tag on section reference.
** DONE Disable all links after finding an auto link (that is enabled).
** DONE Default templates. (templates/default?)
** DONE Book option to set title
** DONE Book option to set author
** DONE Book option to set max section number to use
** DONE Quote strings to not break formatting.
** DONE Include other templates from a template.
** DONE Template for book introduction (including rules etc)
  Sections with some markup (has number 0?) are added as chapters
  of introduction, otherwise formatted identical to other sections.
** DONE Inserting images
** DONE HTML hide intro sections with link to display again
** DONE Only accept specific characters in section names
  eg [a-z][a-z_0-9]+
** DONE Random pick of link to follow from a section.
** DONE Possibility to make predictable random numbers and shuffling for testing
** DONE Test generate examples and compare to expected output in all formats
** DONE Unit tests (finally...)
** DONE Save game (ie player) state
** DONE Load game (ie player) state
** DONE Flag to select what tag(s) to include (eg for demo/preview/short...)
 Allow sections with same name as long as only one is included.
 Add book config for what section to use for references to excluded sections
  (eg links to outside of demo version can lead to section explaining that)
** DONE Counters (life, money, whatever) create and set
  count tag to declare new counter, text in tag is display name
  optional argument sets the starting value of the tag
  display somewhere on page (in HTML output)
** DONE Counters increase/decrease
** DONE Counters check
** DONE Make sure HTML output works with javascript disabled
    and in inferior browsers
** DONE Make sure counters start at 0 (not 1).
** DONE Remove the counter names from counter-tags output (and templates).
** DONE Buy (optionally decrease a counter to add something to a collection)
  buy tag to specify what can be bought, eg [buy item]sword[/buy]
  followed by cost tag to specify what it will cost, eg [cost gold]3[/cost]
  Implemented by adding cost to the old found tag (put cost tag after it).
  Might reconsider and make explicit buy tag for clarity?
** DONE Add text template used for outputting non-tagged (plain) text.
** DONE Named references, when that style is wanted (especially for HTML).
** DONE Seems to be a bug in rtf template, inserting image filename.
** DONE Javascript tests running in nodejs (no GUI)
  The big scripts in html templates are split out into separate files
  already (script.html and endscript.html). It should be possible to
  test those from nodejs?
** DONE Make debug output more useful with a stricter format easy to parse.
   Will be taken care of when implementing JSON output.
** TODO Pick a specific number of things from those found in a(n intro) section
  Used to pick up one or more of something found, or before starting.
  Create counter and set to how many are allowed to be picked.
  Add buy (and cost) tags for what can be taken.
    Need to make sure it is rendered in a good way (might need more tags).
  Set max of the counter used to 0 and never allow navigation while
   some counter is above its max.
  Without setting the max player can decide to pick up fewer (or none) which
   might of course also be ok at times.
  This will also work for picking eg starting skills.
** DONE Subtract from counter when following link (implies has at least that)
  This is the cost tag again, when it immediately follows a reference.
** TODO Add keyword when following link
  This is a new tag that follows a reference similar to a cost tag.
** TODO Remove keyword when following link
  This is a new tag that follows a reference similar to a cost tag.
** TODO Use points to buy values for counters
 Eg to buy starting values for some attributes in introsection.
** TODO Counter max values, not leaving a section too early
  Use cost tag following inc tag to set price for increasing a counter.
  Set max for points to 0.
  Do not allow navigation until all points are spent (ie never allows
   following links while a counter is above its max value).
  The same mechanism can of course be used in-game at any section to
   allow the player to buy increases in different counters.
** TODO Tag to remove counter when following link
   What if a reference leads back to somewhere that counter is used?
   In that case will revive the counter automatically.
   Remove will only hide from GUI really.
** TODO Combat
   Tag to set config parameters for combat system (probably in introsection).
   Tag to mark up the link to use to trigger next round.
   Tag to mark up retreat link.
   Tag to mark up enemy starting values.
   JavaScript easy to override parts of system, but quite configurable
    just using the config parameters.
   Allow multiple combat systems in the same book.
** TODO Some way to insert character sheet in book introduction
   Using a PNG image is not nice. Not sure yet what tags are needed.
** TODO Defensive removal of any weird unicode not handled by quoting.
** TODO Somewhat user-friendly python error messages and always fail early
** TODO Somewhat user-friendly js error messages and always fail early
** TODO More formatting possibilities in sections
  Look at existing gamebooks to get ideas to add to this todo list.
** TODO Document Gamebook format
  - Basic gamebook (static, nothing about magic needed for dynamic; tutorial)
  - Advanced (more complex layout options, but still static)
  - Dynamic (markup needed to make playable (HTML) version)
  - Standard output formats reference
  - Customization (make new output formats or override existing)
** TODO HTML with javascript active, do not make new URLs (that break history)
** TODO Javascript GUI tests running in a browser
  Preferably headless (in nodejs?). Run tests on gamebook html example(s).
  Work on laptop stashed as zombietest (using zombietest obviously).
** TODO HTML CSS
** TODO Fix broken references in list option output for some tag
When using the list option, and only including only sections for a tag,
there currently has to be a missingto section, and that section is always
listed even if it is not tagged.
** TODO Add json output file containing sections, counters, collections etc.
   This output format down-prioed because requires some changes to handle new-lines.
   All previously supported formats handles new-lines in text without problems, JSON do not.
   New-lines are added in ways that can currently not be affected by quoting functions.
** TODO Sell (optionally increase a counter to drop something from a collection)
  sell tag to specify what can be bought, eg [sell item]sword[/sell]
  followed by cost tag to specify what it will cost, eg [cost gold]2[/cost]
  Might want to wait with this and add normal drop function first?
  This is like payPrice but a negative cost? Sort of.
** TODO Tags for current format
   Automatic upper-case tags excluded not matching output format, eg when
    generating a HTML file all sections tagged PDF or TXT are excluded
    (unless also tagged as HTML of course). Sections with no format
    tag are always included, so this has to be handled somewhat
    differently from the normal include/exclude tags unfortunately.
   Allow multiple sections with the same name, only use one that matches,
    or treat as any other missing section otherwise.
** TODO Dummy and fake sections (handle properly when verifying)
