** DONE LaTeX output
** DONE RTF output
** DONE HTML output
** DONE Split out template hanlding into separate class from output
** DONE Inject Output dependencies
** DONE Save section-number mapping and reuse automatically
** DONE Add support for custom document templates.
  Fixed names and/or command-line options.

** DONE Check if has codeword
** DONE Remove item from inventory (forced by instructions)
** DONE Enable link if not having an item
** DONE Enable link if not having a codeword
** DONE Make sure dropped items can not be picked up again
** DONE Fix problem with map file from other book sometimes crashing formatter
** DONE Keys from formatted book should be added to map file, not replace it
** DONE Make inventory and codewords generic
  They are the same, sort of, and it might be good to be able to
  add other similar entities as well, like skills or spells or whatever.
** DONE Otherwise/else handling for has.
** DONE Redesign otherwise/else to use xor tag on section reference.
** DONE Disable all links after finding an auto link (that is enabled).
** DONE Default templates. (templates/default?)
** DONE Book option to set title
** DONE Book option to set author
** DONE Book option to set max section number to use
** DONE Quote strings to not break formatting.
** DONE Include other templates from a template.
** DONE Template for book introduction (including rules etc)
  Sections with some markup (has number 0?) are added as chapters
  of introduction, otherwise formatted identical to other sections.
** DONE Inserting images
** DONE HTML hide intro sections with link to display again
** DONE Only accept specific characters in section names
  eg [a-z][a-z_0-9]+
** DONE Random pick of link to follow from a section.
** DONE Possibility to make predictable random numbers and shuffling for testing
** DONE Test generate examples and compare to expected output in all formats
** DONE Unit tests (finally...)
** DONE Save game (ie player) state
** DONE Load game (ie player) state
** DONE Flag to select what tag(s) to include (eg for demo/preview/short...)
 Allow sections with same name as long as only one is included.
 Add book config for what section to use for references to excluded sections
  (eg links to outside of demo version can lead to section explaining that)
** DONE Counters (life, money, whatever) create and set
  count tag to declare new counter, text in tag is display name
  optional argument sets the starting value of the tag
  display somewhere on page (in HTML output)
** DONE Counters increase/decrease
** DONE Counters check
** DONE Make sure HTML output works with javascript disabled
    and in inferior browsers
** DONE Make sure counters start at 0 (not 1).
** DONE Remove the counter names from counter-tags output (and templates).
** DONE Buy (optionally decrease a counter to add something to a collection)
  buy tag to specify what can be bought, eg [buy item]sword[/buy]
  followed by cost tag to specify what it will cost, eg [cost gold]3[/cost]
  Implemented by adding cost to the old found tag (put cost tag after it).
  Might reconsider and make explicit buy tag for clarity?
** DONE Add text template used for outputting non-tagged (plain) text.
** DONE Named references, when that style is wanted (especially for HTML).
** DONE Seems to be a bug in rtf template, inserting image filename.
** DONE JavaScript tests running in nodejs (no GUI)
  The big scripts in html templates are split out into separate files
  already (script.html and endscript.html). It should be possible to
  test those from nodejs?
** DONE Make debug output more useful with a stricter format easy to parse.
   Will be taken care of when implementing JSON output.
** DONE checkgamebook.py script, parse debug file JSON
   CLOSED: [2014-09-23 Tue 21:52]
** DONE checkgamebook.py build internal section graph
   CLOSED: [2014-09-23 Tue 23:10]
** DONE checkgamebook.py find unreachable sections
   CLOSED: [2014-09-23 Tue 23:10]
** DONE Debug output should be called just JSON
   CLOSED: [2014-09-24 Wed 21:36]
** Make default templates for more tags
   CLOSED: [2015-04-08 Wed 21:01]
   Many tags can default to do the same as a b-tag for bold for instance.
   Make as many DEFAULT templates as possible and remove format-specific ones.
   This will make further development so much more nice.
   Actually not doing this, because the default just showing inner text
   is the best default anyway.
** DONE Paged option
   CLOSED: [2015-04-08 Wed 21:31]
   Option -o paged to make each section render on its own page.
   Add template overrides for at least html, tex, and rtf.
   Probably change the style for section headers as well.
** TODO include templates for generating tags for each section
	start, separator, end (probably only for JSON and HTML now)
** TODO include templates for generating book config
	start, separator, end (probably only for JSON and HTML now)
** TODO JavaScript improved design/code for what links to enable
   Many strange things can happen when clicking one link changes something
   that should now enable or disable some link. Instead of the current
   hacks all links should be re-calculated every time something have been
   clicked, doing the same checks as when first displaying a section.
** TODO Reset tag
	Show in dynamic HTML only, and only after something was changed in
   	current section. Eg if player picks something up or buys something,
	then wants to undo that, there should be a link to do so. Text inside
	of tags is displayed as the clickable link to reset section.
** TODO return-links
  Insert reference link to return to most recent section tagged as :RETURNHERE:.
  This will be based on the order sections are written in the file (for now?).
  This is probably a special case (ie hack) based on normal references.
** TODO :UNIQUE: tag
  If a section has a :UNIQUE: tag, every link to it creates a new unique copy
  with automatically generated name. This is not recursive, so to make entire
 subtrees that are unique every section in the subtree must be tagged.
  This is done early in the parsing, so everything will treat the clones as
 different sections. If a number is given it is applied to first generated clone.
 That is probably not very useful but whatever.
** TODO Pick a specific number of things from those found in a(n intro) section
  Used to pick up one or more of something found, or before starting.
  Create counter and set to how many are allowed to be picked.
  Add buy (and cost) tags for what can be taken.
    Need to make sure it is rendered in a good way (might need more tags).
  This will also work for picking eg starting skills.
** DONE Subtract from counter when following link (implies has at least that)
  This is the cost tag again, when it immediately follows a reference.
** DONE Remove keyword (or item) when picking up something
   Trade one thing from a collection to add something else to some collection.
** TODO Add keyword (or item) when following link
  This is a new tag that follows a reference similar to a cost tag.
** DONE Remove keyword (or item) when following link
  This is a new tag that follows a reference similar to a cost tag.
** TODO Fix bug in HTML with being able to click disabled things
   It is possible sometimes to follow a disabled reference or
   pick something up even when not having enough to pay its price.
   Seems to only happen with things that do have a price, not those
   disabled for other reasons.
** TODO When buying or trading for something, it can be receievd again
   The js code to make sure that something you have had but later dropped
   can not be picked up again seems to be broken for things that
   have a price.
** TODO automatic configurable explanation for things that were dropped
   When disabling something found because it was dropped, display a
   warning after automatically,eg default "(not available because you already picked it up)"
   in some good style.
** TODO Use points to buy values for counters
 Eg to buy starting values for some attributes in introsection.
** TODO Counter max values, not leaving a section too early
  Use cost tag following inc tag to set price for increasing a counter.
  Set max for points to 0.
  Do not allow navigation until all points are spent (ie never allows
   following links while a counter is above its max value).
  The same mechanism can of course be used in-game at any section to
   allow the player to buy increases in different counters.
** TODO Tag to remove counter when following link
   What if a reference leads back to somewhere that counter is used?
   In that case will revive the counter automatically.
   Remove will only hide from GUI really.
** TODO Combat
   Tag to set config parameters for combat system (probably in introsection).
   Tag to mark up the link to use to trigger next round.
   Tag to mark up retreat link.
   Tag to mark up enemy starting values.
   JavaScript easy to override parts of system, but quite configurable
    just using the config parameters.
   Allow multiple combat systems in the same book.
** TODO Some way to insert character sheet in book introduction
   Using a PNG image is not nice. Not sure yet what tags are needed.
   Probably a charactersheet template that is only non-empty for formats
   it makes sense in. For HTML all the inventory stuff etc could be moved
   into the character sheet, making it also available in the static HTML.
** TODO Defensive removal of any weird unicode not handled by quoting.
** TODO Somewhat user-friendly python error messages and always fail early
** TODO Somewhat user-friendly js error messages and always fail early
** TODO More formatting possibilities in sections
  Look at existing gamebooks to get ideas to add to this todo list.
** TODO Document Gamebook format Basic gamebook (static, nothing about magic needed for dynamic)
** TODO Document Gamebook format Advanced (more complex layout options, but still static)
** TODO Document Gamebook format Dynamic (markup needed to make playable (HTML) version)
** TODO Document Gamebook format Standard output formats reference
** TODO Document Gamebook format Customization (make new output formats or override existing)
** TODO Reference documentation (all default template tags)
** TODO Make it possible for a modifier tag to refer to any other tag
Currently a modifier (eg cost) always applies to tag on its left or right,
and it can be a bit confusing to remember what direction, or awkward to
write the text in a good way to follow that rule. Make it possible to add
to a tag what it applies to (eg what item or reference the cost should apply to,
anywhere in the section).
** TODO HTML with javascript active, do not make new URLs (that break history)
** TODO JavaScript GUI tests running in a browser
  Preferably headless (in nodejs?). Run tests on gamebook html example(s).
  Work on laptop stashed as zombietest (using zombietest obviously).
** TODO HTML CSS
** TODO Fix broken references in list option output for some tag
When using the list option, and only including only sections for a tag,
there currently has to be a missingto section, and that section is always
listed even if it is not tagged.
** DONE Add json output file containing sections, counters, collections etc.
   CLOSED: [2014-09-23 Tue 21:29]
   This output format down-prioed because requires some changes to handle new-lines.
   All previously supported formats handles new-lines in text without problems, JSON do not.
   New-lines are added in ways that can currently not be affected by quoting functions.
   Made debug format json. Will fix new-line problems when seen (not so far).
** TODO Sell (optionally increase a counter to drop something from a collection)
  sell tag to specify what can be bought, eg [sell item]sword[/sell]
  followed by cost tag to specify what it will cost, eg [cost gold]2[/cost]
  Might want to wait with this and add normal drop function first?
  This is like payPrice but a negative cost? Sort of.
** DONE Tags for current format
   Automatic upper-case tags excluded not matching output format, eg when
    generating a HTML file all sections tagged PDF or TXT are excluded
    (unless also tagged as HTML of course). Sections with no format
    tag are always included, so this has to be handled somewhat
    differently from the normal include/exclude tags unfortunately.
   Allow multiple sections with the same name, only use one that matches,
    or treat as any other missing section otherwise.
** TODO checkgamebook.py ignore dummy and fake sections
** TODO checkgamebook.py trace items to find sections they are needed but can not have been found
** TODO tag to generate checkgamebook.py warnings
   Some tag that can be set on incomplete sections to trigger warnings
   as a reminder that the book is not done yet, and show you what
   sections remain to be written.
** TODO Generic MAP section numbers substitution script
   Use generated MAP file to insert section numbers in any external file.
