- [ ] Dummy and fake sections (handle properly when verifying)

  Inline prefix on link or :inline: tag on target section itself.
  If tagged or all links to a section are marked inline the section
  itself is removed.

- [ ] Sell (optionally increase a counter to drop something from a collection)
- [ ] Pick a (maximum) number of things from those found in a section
- [ ] Javascript tests running in nodejs (no GUI)
  The big scripts in html templates are split out into separate files
  already (script.html and endscript.html). It should be possible to
  test those from nodejs?

  Preferably headless (in nodejs?). Run tests on gamebook html example(s).
- [ ] Combat
  Tag to mark up the link to use to trigger next round.
  Tag to mark up the enemy and its values.
  Fixed set of combat abilities handled by javascript
    (some way to configure ability names, but in that case javascript
     for combat, in a separate file, must be overridden)

  - Standard output formats reference
  - Customization (make new output formats or override existing)
